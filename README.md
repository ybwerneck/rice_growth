This is a initial short descripition of the project:

basemodel contains the base model definition and shoud work standalone to easily try and test the model.

modelsdeploy contains optimization for using gpus to run the models, usefull of large sampling and multigenerational. 

1danalysis uses the gpu solver to solve a large sample of models and assemble the heatmaps.

multigen uses the gpu solver to perfom the multigenerational simulation.
